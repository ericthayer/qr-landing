## Overview

A front-end landing page prototype created as an option for [Onsite Support](https://onsitesupport.io/) customers. This has a "mobile-only" approach that focuses on a specific product toâ€”highlight features, information, or registration options. This package would not require the need to develop a responsive soulution for larger screens since the content has been streamlined to a few items, actions grouped, and the minimal UI allows you clearly view the hero media.

## Performance Audits

We are taking performance hits by using YouTube as our video source. Embedding video without third-party bloat is ideal. Either way, we should create a [`facade`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/third-party-facades/) to help limit the amount of code needed for first paint. We see some gains when we add `loading=lazy` & remove `autoplay`.

[Video Autoplay](https://qrlanding.netlify.app/](https://qrlanding.netlify.app/perf/autoplay)) | [No Autoplay](https://support.onsitesupport.io/](https://qrlanding.netlify.app/perf/no-autoplay))
